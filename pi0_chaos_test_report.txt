### ASSESSMENT: POOR
The Pi0 system fails to maintain stability under stress and does not recover well from failures. A complete redesign may be necessary.

## Recommendations

- Improve baseline stability by refining the prime rotation operator.
- Enhance chaos resistance by implementing adaptive fractal wavelets.
- Strengthen quantum fluctuation resistance by optimizing the entanglement matrix.
- Improve recovery mechanisms, particularly for: dimension_collapse, energy_cube_fracture, quantum_decoherence, prime_rotation_disruption, g4_symmetry_violation.
- Develop better coordination between energy cube and pi batteries under combined stress.
